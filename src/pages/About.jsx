        Hello! I'm Tan√© - a 27 year old currently based in the lush surroundings
        of the foothills of the Dandenong Ranges in Melbourne, Victoria. As a
        student of Web Development at Coder Academy I spend most of my time
        learning and practising code, sharpening my problem solving skills and
        learning more about the world of tech. My adventure into the world of
        coding may not have started long ago, however I've already learned an
        immense amount of valuable practical lessons and industry specific
        knowledge.
